              Gudetama (ぐでたま Gudetama) is a Sanrio character who debuted in
              2013. The character is the yolk of an unfertilized egg, devoid of
              gender. Gudetama is often depicted reclining on an egg white or as
              an ingredient in a Japanese dish. Gudetama’s main trait is
              laziness. The name Gudetama is derived from the Japanese words for
              lazy (ぐでぐで gude gude) and egg (卵 tamago). Gudetama debuted
              following a contest run by Sanrio to introduce new characters
              based on Japanese food, in which Gudetama came second to
              Kirimi-chan. <br /><br />Gudetama has proven popular in Japan,
              leading to the opening of a number of themed pop-up cafes serving
              egg-related dishes. A plentiful selection of character goods are
              also available, ranging from stationery to confectionery to toys.
              Gudetama goods have been sold at a number of dedicated pop-up
              stores across Japan. <br />

              Gudetama is the lazy egg with a cute butt with preferred pronouns
              that are unknown. The character is an indirect result of the
              Japanese producing Anime about literally any topic possible. Much
              like most college students, Gudetama is lazy, depressed,
              childlike, and doesn't like being bothered. <br />
              <br />
              The character is a metaphor for how unbearable it is to exist.
              Much like UC Berkeley, having to live in such an environment is
              depressing and the best thing to do is use bacon as a blanket and
              sausage as a pillow. Toast also looks like a comfy bed. <br />
